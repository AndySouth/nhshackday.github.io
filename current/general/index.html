<p>The pitches and presentations, as well as the welcome and closing sessions, will be in the Sitting Room.</p>
<p>Ziferblat is on the 1st floor of the building, but it has its own dedicated lift and is fully accessible.</p>

<h2 id="signup">I want to pitch/present</h2>
<div class = "well well-large">

    <h2>Pitches</h2>
         <p>We will be using an interoperable, cross-platform, intuitive, multilingual framework called Paper for listing those who wish to pitch an idea or describe their NHS IT problem. Simply write your name/team name and brief title or description of the idea on the flip charts provided.</p>

         <p>Following on from its successes at previous NHS Hack Days, Paper is scalable, easy to configure, supports a range of UX options, while being at least as water-resistant as other technical solutions. Load balancing is activated OOTB with Paper, but please avoid a DDoS by queuing nicely.</p>

    <h4>Guidelines for pitching</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Strict time limit of 2 minutes (depending a little on numbers).</li>
          <li>No AV materials please - there simply isn't time.</li>
          <li>You don't need to have thought of the <em>solution</em> in order to pitch a problem - just pitch to the room, which is full of experience and intelligence, and see if someone can help you come up with the solution.
          <li>When signup closes we'll randomise the running order and project it on the screen so everyone will know what's happening.</li>
        </ul>
