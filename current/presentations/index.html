<h4>Guidelines for presentations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict time limit of <u>3-4 mins</u> (tbc) depending on numbers</li>
      <li>Please submit slides in advance with the form above (there's some special upload magic)</li>
      <li>Live demos are brilliant, but terrifying and often time-consuming: consider explaining your project another way instead (plus then we won't have to wrestle tediously with the AV equipment for multiple devices).</li>
  </ul>
