<h4>Guidelines for presentations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict time limit of <u>3-4 mins</u> (tbc) depending on numbers</li>
      <li>Please submit slides in advance with the form above. You should give us <u>the URL of a public web-accessible presentation</u> (using something like Prezi or Google Presentation) or <u>the URL of a pdf containing your slides</u>.</li>
      <li>You can demo your project live if required, but only by navigating to a public web address using the machine already set up with our AV equipment; basically, you can't plug in your own machine to our AV equipment. This is for the sake of common sense, time limits and everyone's sanity.</li>
  </ul>
