  <h2>Pitches</h2>

<h4>Forms</h4>
   We will be using an interoperable, cross-platform, intuitive, multilingual framework called Paper for recording people's wich to pitch. Simply write your name/team name and brief title or description of the idea on the flip charts provided. Following on from its successes at previous NHS Hack Days, Paper is scalable, easy to configure, supports a range of UX options, while being at least as water-resistant as other technical solutions. Load balancing is activated OOTB with Paper, but please avoid a DDoS by queuing nicely.

<h4>Guidelines for pitching</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict time limit of 2 minutes (depending a little on numbers).</li>
      <li>No AV materials please - there simply isn't time.</li>
      <li>When signup closes we'll randomise the running order and project it on the screen so everyone will know what's happening.
    </ul>
