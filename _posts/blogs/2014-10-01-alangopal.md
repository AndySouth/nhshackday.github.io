Two days?  To create a finished healthcare IT product with strangers from different disciplines?  This sounds crazy, I have to go see now.  That was the general train of thought that ran through my head after going on the website.  As a final year medical student (a student doctor to the uninitiated) my time has suddenly become so much sparser and every decision has to have some rationale behind it, either making me a better doctor or dedicating time to ensure I pass exams.  With the practicalities of the weekend running through my head discouraging me to invest a weekend in a completely unknown venture, my curiosity won out in the end (plus the recommendation to attend from the lovely Anne Marie Cunningham).

When I turned up (late as luck would have it, as I’d moved into York in the early hours of the morning before driving over) the first sight that greeted me in the room were the huddles of people around computers quietly chatting, or typing furiously.  Reading the list of prospective project pitches after a very friendly John Pyle welcomed me in and explained the details, I had to make a choice; which team should I ask to join?

The renal wardlist handover sounded the most intriguing to me; I could think up ways I could help, whereas I was struggling to come up with ways I could contribute to any of the other projects.  It was also the idea I agreed with the most as it would benefit junior doctors in particular (my next stage if I pass my exams).  So I took the plunge, sat down, explained who I was and asked if I could join (with obvious trepidation).  Thankfully, James Morgan, Brinley Walker (both junior doctors from North Bristol NHS Trust) and David Miller (Open Health Care UK) all looked quite happy with me and got me involved.

It was refreshing just to focus solely on the viability of a project as a team; often there are personal and professional agendas that drive healthcare changes and dilute innovation these days, while at the Hack Day it was solely the project that was important.  And the opportunity to talk freely to so many like-minded individuals from such an array of professions was stimulating, I greatly enjoyed the two days.  The quality of the projects presented on Sunday afternoon was very high, so it was an added bonus to come joint-first with the paediatric dental referral project team!

My main take-home message from the Hack Day was how the human drive to create and collaborate can be so strong given the right conditions.  The loss of that creative impulse is often clearly visible on the wards, especially to a student on the wards who often must sit back and observe due to the necessity of patient care taking priority.  So many careless groans and disparaging words about the problems with systems that affect patient care, with little mention of how to take the initiative and help make that change.  The air of resignation, the despairing sigh, the common line of “what can I do, I’m just a [insert job title here]” is infectious.  Just cope with it and carry on.  Hardly a recipe for success.  I think that’s the main lesson the Hackday taught me; never settle, always try.
