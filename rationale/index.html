  <h2>The challenge</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>technology is changing the world, and our expectations</li>
    <li>corporate IT is lagging behind personal IT</li>
    <li>the NHS can't afford to lag behind</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Digital technology as a medium</h2>
	<ul>
      <li>the world is becoming more digital and so is health</li>
	  <li>the medium used to support, and deliver health, matters</li>
	  <li>the medium should be digital but we must do it right</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Openness and digital</h2>
	<ul>
      <li>being open allows social collaboration and gives a competitive advantage (lower costs, higher quality)</li>
      <li>openness is now standard to the technology industry and some parts of government (Cabinet Office)</li>
      <li>openness in technology fits with the openness found in medical and academic culture (no room for black boxes)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Meeting the challenge</h2>

  <p>How can we build an environment where world class NHS digital services flourish?</p>

  <p>Through leadership that understands technology and is bold enough to modernize digital services delivery by embracing openness (open governance and open source)</p>
