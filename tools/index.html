'''Data wishlist'''

 * GPs mapped to non-health geographical areas such as local authorities to support linkages and presentation with other, non-health, information sources
  (This is possible by linking two NHS data files http://nww.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/ods/downloads/gmpdown and http://nww.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/ods/downloads/officenatstats [36mb zipped data file])
 * AHP Referral to Treatment: Collected since April 2011 but not yet published: http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/in-development/community-information-programme/allied-health-professional--referral-to-treatment
 * SUS/HES data - as a minimum aggregates could be made available at useful levels http://www.hesonline.nhs.uk/Ease/servlet/ContentServer?siteID=1937&categoryID=889
 * NICOR - Positive intent but difficult to find datasets http://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/nicor/nicorandtheclinicaldatatransparencyinitiative
 * http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/action/search/basic (to be scraped and mined)
 * http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2010FAI15.html (to be scraped and mined) *UPDATE* 24/5/13 [[attachment:FAIs.zip]]

 * CQC's Quality and Risk Profiles (currently only available to providers and CQC staff
